This readme will guide you to setup your project

### BLIZUU TEST ###

This App lists repositories for public organizations at Github using the Github API "V3"

This project was made as code challenge to Blizuu by A. GonzÃ¡lez

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Crear a virtualenv to the proyect and activate it

    `virtualenv my_porject_virtualenv

    Then activate it

    `source my_porject_virtualenv/bin/activate`

2. Install dependencies

    Go to the project root folder, where you'll fin a `requirements.txt` file and run

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Config your .env file

    Open the file `.env.base` and rename (don't delete) as `.env`
    Here you should configure your app database and the rest of project settings that haven't hardcode in `settings/base.py` or any other setting file

    NOTE: At this point is very important to notice you that if you want to increase your GITHUB Api Rates, you may create an test app in to you github account, accesssing to Settings ->Developer settings -> OAuth Apps and once you've created your app, add your app CLIEND_ID and app CLIENT_SECRET at the end of your .env file as follow:

    * GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID

    * GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET

    * python-decouple: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-decouple

    * dj-database-url: https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url

4. Run migrations

    * 4.1 `python manage.py makemigrations`
    * 4.2 `python manage.py migrate`

5. Create Superuser

    `python manage.py createsuperuser`


### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests

1. Write your test under a folder called `tests` in each app folder

2. Config `pytest.ini` file

   Find  the file called `pytest.ini.base` in your project root folder, rename it (don't delete) to `pytest.ini`

   Open `pytest.ini` and place in the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` settings, the path to your tests settings  (usually the same that your are using to the project)

3. Tests and coverage reports

    * 3.1 Run your tests

    You can run your test simply using pytest

    `pytest`

    NOTE: Pytest is configured with option `--reuse-db`, when you alter your database schema, run `pytest --create-db`, to force re-creation of the test database

    * 3.2 Coverage reports

    If you want to run your test and generate a coverage report, you have to run as follow

    `py.test --cov-report html:cov_html --cov=myapp/tests`

    The above example create a coverage report in HTML format located at the folder `cov_html` in your project root folder
